### Empowering Community Savings Across Africa

---

## Project Overview

AfrikaSave is a community-focused fintech savings platform designed to support digital savings groups (similar to traditional "tontines", "chamas", or "ibimina") across African communities.

The platform allows users to create savings groups, contribute funds virtually, and track collective savings progress.

---

## Problem Statement

Across many African communities, informal savings groups are widely used to pool money and provide financial support. However, these groups often:

- Rely on manual record keeping
- Lack transparency
- Face trust and accountability issues
- Have no digital tracking system

AfrikaSave digitizes group savings management, making contributions transparent, traceable, and secure.
